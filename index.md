title: Rubber Duck Statistics
---

This is a blog for all aspects of statistics and life.

I am a professional statistical consultant, working for a Go8 university in Australia. All observations are my own and do not reflect my employer, whoever they are. Before becoming a statistical consultant 6 years ago (as of May 2025), I was a medical researcher for 16 years. Initially I worked in a wet lab, but swiftly turned to bioinformatics and eventually retrained in statistics, completing a Master of Biostatistics. So all up that is over 20 years of problem solving experience the research-adjacent world.

The title "Rubber Duck Statistics" came to me on one of my many walks around my suburb. It is a reference to the concept of "Rubber Duck Debugging" that I first heard about from my software development colleagues.

As a statistical consultant, my clients often have an epiphany about how to solve their problem after explaining their project and their statistical approach to me in a consulting session. Sometimes I have hardly needed to say anything for them to reach this epiphany. At the end of the session they thank me profusely, and I graciously accept their thanks while simultaneously thinking "I didn't really do anything".

A similar process can occur whenever you talk through a difficult problem. Human beings are social animals, and the stories we tell ourselves and other people often have a clarity that our internal thoughts lack. When you talk about a challenge out loud, it can help you get unstuck. Even if you are talking to a rubber duck. This works for developers trying to debug their software, and it works for researchers trying to analyse their data.

I'd like to believe that as I consultant, I provide more value than a rubber duck. The pure "rubber duck experience" of having hardly said anything in a consult is relatively rare. As a consultant, I ask people for the big picture, and then focus in on the finer detail. I show them their problem from a different, often more quantitative perspective. I often help them solve their problem on the spot, but if I don't, I at least get them on the right track to solve their problem.

Having started this blog in 2025, while working full time, I have no intention of reinventing the wheel, or rehashing anything that has been talked about really clearly and comprehensively in other places. In my experience though, the problems I deal with haven't been discussed clearly and comprehensively in other places. That's why people are coming to me in the first place. It's often a fascinating place to be.

If you find my thoughts and ideas useful please drop me a line. I'd like to hear from you about what resonated. Speaking of which, this blog is proudly AI free. I don't have strong feelings against other people using AI, although I don't currently use it myself much. I do want people to know that they can at least trust that all of the words I write have come from me, and are not a computer-generated mashup of other people's ideas and work.
